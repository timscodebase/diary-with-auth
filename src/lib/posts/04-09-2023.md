Today I am leaving Oregon.  I hgope to return, but first I need to "fix" my life.  Helen and I a staying together; I am very luck for that.  I have a lot of bridges to rebuild the largest of which is the one with Helen.  I put hands on her muliple times and that is something I am not sure I can ever true make amends for.

Helen is helping out again with a Motel, but that help will not last for ever.  At some point very so, I need to be self-supporting ASAP.  Even in a small way.  I will find a Web Job soon, but in the meantime, I need money.
